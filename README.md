# RudraTasks 🚀

My first ever shipped Python project — a command-line To-Do List app!

Built from scratch during school holidays (January 2026) while learning Python.  
I'm 14, from a small city, and this is my start toward becoming a Founder/CEO one day.

## Features
- ➕ Add new tasks
- 📋 View all tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed
- 🗑️ Delete tasks
- 💾 [If you save to file: Tasks saved automatically]
